# Anthos on AWS Lab

## Overview

Anthos is a modern application management platform announced by Google at Next '19. Anthos provides the tools and technology you need for modern, hybrid, and multi-cloud solutions, all built on the foundations of GKE. Anthos enables several features, including:

- Infrastructure provisioning in both cloud and on-premises.
- Infrastructure management tooling, security, policies and compliance solutions.
- Streamlined application development, service discovery and telemetry, service management, and workload migration from on-premises to cloud.

Anthos can be deployed on GCP, on-premises, or in other clouds. This lab focuses on Anthos GKE deployed on AWS.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the scripts and configurations intended for instructional purposes as part of the Anthos on AWS Workshop.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

This lab currently involves:

- Creating a standalone cluster
- Deploying a cluster into a preexisting VPC
- Registering the cluster with GKE Hub
